    first = d["student"]["name"].split()[0]
    prompt = f"""You write one-page end-of-trimester reports for MBA students at Jaipuria Institute of Management.
Audience: the student ({first}), a 22-year-old MBA student in India reading this on a phone. Write like a friendly senior or mentor talking to him, in simple Indian English: short sentences (at most 14 words each), everyday words ("marks", "revise", "class", "quiz", "notes", "faculty"), no metaphors, no jargon, no abstract nouns. If a 15-year-old would not understand a sentence, rewrite it. British/Indian spelling; no em-dashes; no exclamation marks; no praise words ("great", "amazing").
The trimester is CLOSED: the student cannot re-attempt anything. Every takeaway is something to carry into the next trimester, the specialisation, and placement interviews. Never suggest redoing, resubmitting, retaking or practising the same assessment.
HARD RULE: every number you write must be copied exactly from FACTS. Do not compute new numbers.

FACTS (Trimester {d['trimester']}, {d['student']['campus']} campus, batch {d['student']['batch']}, benchmark = {d['benchmark']}):
Subjects, best-to-worst vs class (you_pct / class_pct / delta points / attendance you vs class):
{json.dumps([{k: s.get(k) for k in ('subject','track','you_pct','class_pct','delta','att_you','att_class')} for s in f['subjects']], indent=0)}
Subjects above class average: {len(f['above'])} of {len(f['subjects'])}. Attendance at or above class in {len(f['att_above'])} of {len(f['att'])} subjects.
PATTERN SUBJECT (already chosen, reason: {f['pattern_why']!r}): {json.dumps({k: f['pattern'][k] for k in ('subject','you_pct','class_pct','delta','att_you','att_class')})}; key component: {json.dumps(f['pattern_comp'])}. Your pattern_text must tell THIS story ({'why attending did not turn into marks' if f['pattern_kind'] == 'split' else 'what went right here and how to repeat it' if f['pattern_kind'] == 'strength' else 'how big the gap is and where it comes from'}). Attendance direction in this subject: {att_direction(f['pattern'])} — never state the opposite.
TRACKS (one card each; weakest and strongest component are already chosen, you write the learning; all_components lists every assessed component with its delta vs class so you can see the shape of the subject):
{json.dumps(f['tracks'], indent=0)}

Formatting: percentages carry a % sign (66.7%); gaps are "N points". Numbers appear ONLY in headline, pattern_text and attendance_line, never in track text.

OUTPUT: return ONLY one JSON object, no markdown fences, no commentary, with exactly these keys:
headline, subtitle, pattern_title, pattern_text, attendance_line, tracks (array of {{track, title, learning, interview}}, one per TRACK, same order and same "track" strings as TRACKS above).

Write JSON with:
- headline: a full sentence, <= 12 words, starts with "Hi {first}." then "You ..." stating a SUBJECT-level fact (never a component): how many subjects sat above the class average (e.g. "You scored above your class average in 1 of 6 subjects."), or the subject with the best attendance. Never lead with a gap.
- subtitle: <= 22 words, what this report compares. No numbers.
- pattern_title: <= 8 words, "{first}'s <subject> <noun>" naming the split (e.g. "attendance-marks split").
- pattern_text: 40-65 words, short plain sentences. Sentence 1: subject marks vs class (both numbers). Sentence 2: attendance vs class (both numbers) and what the contrast means in everyday words (e.g. "you attended more classes than most, but the marks did not follow"). Sentence 3: the component that explains it, with its two numbers.
- attendance_line: <= 20 words, must contain "{len(f['att_above'])} of {len(f['att'])} subjects"; no percentages.
- tracks: one object per TRACK, same order, same "track" string. title <= 6 plain words, an instruction he can act on (e.g. "Revise finance notes every week", "Practise explaining ideas aloud"). learning: 20-30 words in 2 short sentences: what the weak component shows, then ONE thing to do next trimester; name the subject and the component in words. Every card must give a DIFFERENT next step; never reuse a sentence across cards. interview: 12-20 words in 1-2 short sentences. The piece of work to mention is ALREADY CHOSEN per track: use its "talk_about" component from TRACKS, name it, and add what to say if asked about the weak area; vary the wording across cards.
What a card must do: (1) say in plain words what the weak component shows, in ONE sentence (a quiz shows whether you remembered what was taught; a group project shows how you work with a team; a presentation shows whether you can explain an idea clearly; a case or simulation shows whether you can apply the idea to a situation); (2) give ONE clear thing to do in the next trimester, in one or two short sentences, something he can start on Monday (for example: read your class notes for ten minutes before every class; make a one-page summary after each topic; practise explaining the topic aloud to a friend; solve last year's quiz questions before the quiz). Never state what topic a component covered unless its name says so. Example of the tone, for a subject NOT in this report: "The quiz in Marketing Research shows the class material was not revised. Before each Marketing class next trimester, read your notes for ten minutes." Example interview line: "Talk about the research project you did. If asked about weak areas, say you now revise every week." Do not copy these sentences.
BANNED anywhere in track text (title, learning, interview): digits, "%", "score", "scored", "scoring", "average", "benchmark", "re-attempt", "retake", "redo", "resubmit", "practise again", "next attempt", "perfect", and jargon such as recall, retrieval, articulation, articulate, cognitive, signpost, narrative, framework, leverage, optimise, synthesis, integrate, discipline, rigour, methodology, mindset, competency, timed conditions, on-the-spot, crib sheet, concept map, rationale, transitions, frame (as a verb), position (as a verb).
