# Moodle MCP — production readiness plan (5,000 Jaipuria users via JChat)

Scope: take the Moodle MCP from "works for a demo / a few faculty" to "safe and
reliable for ~5,000 students + professors through JChat." Grouped by priority with
owner and rough effort. **P0 = launch blocker.** Synthesised from the Sept 2026
hardening + JChat-integration + activity-recording work.

Legend — owner: **ops** (Render/Supabase/env, not doable from code), **eng** (this
repo), **rajika** (JChat repo), **decision** (data owner).

---

## P0 — Launch blockers

**0.1 Move off the Render free plan.** `render.yaml` declares `plan: standard`, but the
LIVE service still runs the **free plan** (spin-down) per its own header comment. Free
= cold-start tool-call hangs + no concurrency headroom → unusable at 5,000. → Set the
live service to an always-on paid plan; confirm it never spins down; size for expected
concurrency. *(ops · ½ day)*

**0.2 Pin the OAuth keys; they caused a real outage.** `OAUTH_STORAGE_ENCRYPTION_KEY`
and `OAUTH_JWT_SIGNING_KEY` must be **stable, permanent** values. A changed encryption
key orphaned every registered client ("client ID not found", forced re-add) on
2026-09-18. Rotation is now safe via the comma-separated keyset (MultiFernet, shipped
`018f4c3`), and an unstable signing key logs everyone out each deploy. → Confirm both
are fixed dashboard values; document them as never-regenerate. *(ops · 1 h + eng done)*

**0.3 Stand up activity recording.** The `mcp_audit` backend was never applied to prod,
so **nothing is recorded today**. → Follow `scripts/RECORDING_ENABLEMENT.md`: apply
`sql/2026-09-18_mcp_audit_backend.sql`, mint the `mcp_audit_writer` JWT, set the audit +
capture env. *(ops/eng · ½ day)*

**0.4 Fix rate limiting for the JChat topology.** All JChat MCP traffic egresses **one
Railway IP**, so the per-IP cap (`MCP_IP_RATE_LIMIT` = 1200/min ≈ 20 rps) becomes the
ceiling for *all* users and will throttle the cohort. And with >1 instance the
in-process limiter diverges. → Set `MCP_REDIS_URL` for shared limiting, and either raise
the per-IP cap substantially for the trusted JChat origin **or** cut traffic over to the
governed gateway (`GATEWAY_ENFORCED`, single trusted ingress). Per-principal 90/min
still bounds each user. *(ops + eng · 1 day)*

**0.4a `create_report` cost cap (done 2026-09-21).** Per-principal budget on the one
money-spending tool (`_enforce_report_budget`, default 60/user/hour via
`MCP_CREATE_REPORT_LIMIT` / `_WINDOW_SECONDS`), so no single account can drive runaway
LLM generation under open access. Redis-backed when `MCP_REDIS_URL` is set (so set it —
0.4 — for the cap to hold across instances). *(eng — shipped)*

**0.5 Governance sign-off for all-access + full recording.** Every `jaipuria.ac.in`
account (incl. ~2,800 students) has **all-campus, faculty-level** access, and recording
now stores **real identity + which student records each person viewed + the marks
returned**, for everyone. That is the data owner's stated choice — but before launch:
lock the `mcp_audit` schema to admins only; publish a privacy-notice line; keep raw PII
out of New Relic; confirm 180-day retention (`purge_expired_mcp_security_data`). If
"students see only their own data" is ever wanted, that's the gateway RBAC or an in-MCP
student self-scope (both scoped, not built). *(decision + ops · ½ day)*

---

## P1 — High (before or immediately after launch)

**1.0 Claude.ai connector: cross-client PKCE flag (found in review).** `OAUTH_ALLOW_CROSS_CLIENT_PKCE`
now defaults **off**, so the OAuthProxy no longer tolerates Claude.ai's multi-node
pattern (register on one node, authorize/redeem across others) unless BOTH
`OAUTH_ALLOW_CROSS_CLIENT_PKCE=true` **and** the redeeming host is in `OAUTH_REDIRECT_HOSTS`.
Left off, the hosted Claude.ai connector can hit `mcp_token_exchange_failed` — a likely
contributor to the re-auth pain. Cryptographically it's a hardening (default-deny,
bounded), so keep it off in general but **set both on the deployments that serve the
Claude.ai connector**. *(ops · 15 min)*

**1.1 Report generation at scale.** `create_report` in sync mode blocks under load;
queue mode (migration 0014, applied) + a worker scales it. Confirm `AGENT_REPORT_QUEUE`
+ `AGENT_SHARED_SECRET`, and that the **moodle-agent** service is also off the free
plan. S3 report caching (shipped) limits regen cost. *(ops + eng · 1 day)*

**1.2 Monitoring & alerting.** The MCP emits **no OTel/metrics** — Supabase audit +
stderr only. → Add New Relic (EU acct 8495484): health/uptime, error-rate, p95 latency
per tool, active users; alert on 5xx spikes and health failures. The `mcp_audit`
ledger + `v_activity` view give the usage dashboards. *(eng · 2 days)*

**1.3 CI gate.** 206 tests exist but nothing runs them on PRs. → GitHub Actions:
import check + all `tests/*.py` on every PR to `main`. *(eng · 2 h)*

**1.4 JChat prompt correlation.** Add the `X-Request-Id` header (see
`docs/JCHAT_PROMPT_CORRELATION.md`) so activity joins to the prompt that caused it.
*(rajika · 1 h)*

**1.5 `jaipuriaschools.ac.in` handling.** JChat admits that domain as USER, but the MCP
denies it (not a subdomain of `jaipuria.ac.in`). Confirm that's intended (schools staff
have no MBA data) and that the denial is a clean, explained message, not an error.
*(decision · 15 min)*

**1.6 Deploy hygiene.** `/health` zero-downtime deploys are set. Confirm the live
service actually reconnects OAuth sessions across deploys now that keys are pinned
(0.2) — i.e. the "re-auth on every deploy" symptom is gone. *(ops · verify)*

---

## P2 — Hardening / scale tail

- **2.1 Google tokeninfo per request.** `verify_token` calls Google on every request →
  latency + quota at 5,000 concurrent. Confirm/enable token caching. *(eng)*
- **2.2 S3 offload for oversized capture.** Payloads > 256 KB store a size-marked
  preview; add a Supabase Storage offload (pointer in the row) if truly-complete large
  payloads are required. *(eng · 1 day)*
- **2.3 Deploy the gateway** (`rehearsal-mcp-gateway`, PR #1) for per-tool RBAC + single
  ingress — also resolves 0.4 (rate-limit origin) and enables student-scoping later.
  *(eng/ops)*
- **2.4 Scheduled purge.** pg_cron `select public.purge_expired_mcp_security_data();`
  daily, so audit + OAuth state respect retention automatically. *(ops)*
- **2.5 Load test** the target concurrency (ramp 150 → 500 → 5,000) before the full
  cohort; watch DB connections, tokeninfo latency, audit write throughput. *(eng)*
- **2.6 Backups/DR** posture for the audit ledger and OAuth store confirmed. *(ops)*

2. [ ] `OAUTH_STORAGE_ENCRYPTION_KEY` + `OAUTH_JWT_SIGNING_KEY` pinned & documented (0.2)
3. [ ] Audit backend applied + credential + capture env set; `v_activity` shows rows (0.3)
4. [ ] `MCP_REDIS_URL` set; per-IP limit raised or gateway enforced (0.4)
5. [ ] Governance: `mcp_audit` locked to admins, privacy notice, retention (0.5)
6. [ ] Report queue + worker; moodle-agent off free plan (1.1)
7. [ ] New Relic health/error/latency alerts live (1.2)
8. [ ] CI running tests on PRs (1.3)
9. [ ] JChat `X-Request-Id` header deployed; join verified (1.4)
10. [ ] Cohort ramp 150 → 500 → 5,000 with monitoring (2.5)

## Status snapshot (2026-09-18)
- **Done & deployed:** all-Jaipuria access; name-or-id resolution (`c0cd4d9`); report
  directness; OAuth rotation-tolerant keyset (`018f4c3`); activity-capture code (flag-
  gated); 206 tests green.
- **Ready, awaiting ops:** audit backend migration + recording enablement (0.3);
  capture-ON `render.yaml` (uncommitted — enabling mass PII capture is classifier-gated
  from here, so a human commits it).
- **Not started:** hosting plan flip, Redis, monitoring, CI, gateway, load test.
